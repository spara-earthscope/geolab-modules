    "# Reading Python Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing code is a skill that takes time. However, reading is an equally important skill that leads to mastering writing code. In this section, we'll examine a piece of code and you'll replicate that in a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This code downloads a miniSEED file from an AWS S3 bucket. Let's break it down.\n",
    "```\n",
    "import boto3\n",
    "from obspy import read\n",
    "import io \n",
    "\n",
    "# s3 setup\n",
    "session = boto3.Session(profile_name=\"default\")\n",
    "s3_client = session.client('s3')\n",
    "region_name = \"us-east-2\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define bucket and key\n",
    "bucket_name = 'my-miniseed'\n",
    "object_key = 'WCI/2014/001/WCI.IU.2014.001'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Download object to memory\n",
    "response = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=object_key)\n",
    "data_stream = io.BytesIO(response['Body'].read())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Parse with ObsPy\n",
    "st = read(data_stream)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the ObsPy Streams\n",
    "print(st)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part specifies or imports the packages we need. Here's the breakdown of the packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- boto3: this package is used to interact with AWS API, including services such as S3\n",
    "- obspy: a popular package for analyzing seismic data\n",
    "- io: Python's built in module for reading data streams\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're unfamiliar with S3, its a form of data storage for objects. Unlike files, which allow reading or changing portions of a file, objects can't be changed and only recreated. Boto3 uses the AWS API to get and read the object, we have the option to save the object as a file to our computer; but the more efficient and faster way to get the data from an object is to read it as a stream and write it into memory. Doing this avoids the overhead of creating and writing a file to disk. This isn't significant for tens of objects, but if you're working with hundreds or more files, its more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**# s3 setup**\n",
    "This section uses boto3 to authenticate to a AWS S3 account. Typically, you will have a configuration file on your computer with your AWS credentials. Boto3 can read the credentials, i.e. `profile_name=default`, and creates a client that connects to s3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**# Define bucket and key**\n",
    "S3 have unique names for buckets, the AWS equivalent term for the name of a drive. Buckets have folders, analogous to directories; and seismic data have a folder hierchy organized like this \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/bucket\n",
    "|__station\n",
    "          |__year\n",
    "                |__day\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each object has a name, or key. A miniSEED object key is formatted as `STATION.NETWORK.YEAR.DAY`. Note that DAY contains three characters and is zero padded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**# Download object to memory**\n",
    "The `s3_client` is used to read the object data from s3 into your computer's memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "**# Parse with Obspy**\n",
    "The ObsPy `read` module was imported earlier and we use it to read the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**# Print the ObsPy Streams**\n",
    "Finally we print the data out to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you are in the geolab directory and the geolab-env is activated. Refer to the Notebook Basics section and create a new notebook. Name the notebook `get_data.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the geolab-env is empty, we will need to add Python packages. Our first task is to download seismic data from an AWS S3 bucket. To accomplish this, we will need a package that can connect to an S3 bucket."
