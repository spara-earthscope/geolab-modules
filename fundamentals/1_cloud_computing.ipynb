    "Cloud workflows leverage cloud computing resources to execute tasks across distributed environments by utilizing virtual machines, containers, and serverless architectures. The cloud approach provides flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency because resources can be dynamically allocated and scaled based on demand. Cloud workflows provide easy access to shared resources and data over the internet, which makes them well-suited for collaborative tasks shared by geographically dispersed teams. Additionally, cloud platforms integrate with a wide range of services and tools, facilitating seamless workflow automation, data analysis, and machine learning.\n",

    "Cloud computing provides on-demand access to computing resources over the internet, enabling scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency. Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Elasticity: Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand.\n",
    "- Pay-as-you-go pricing: Users pay only for the resources they consume.\n",
    "- Managed services: Cloud providers handle maintenance, security, and updates.\n",
    "- Broad accessibility: Services are available remotely via the internet.\n",
    "- Common cloud computing use cases include web hosting, SaaS applications, and - general-purpose workloads.\n"
