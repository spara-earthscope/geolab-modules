    "# Intro to Git \n",
    "\n",
    "## Keeping track of code\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system (VCS). It's used by software developers to track changes to their code over time, enabling collaboration and efficient management of project versions. Think of it as a sophisticated \"undo\" button and a way to manage different versions of files, especially useful when multiple people are working on the same project. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is installed in GeoLab. However, if you want to check if git is installed on a computer, use the version flag which returns the version of git.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a distributed system, that means you can have a version of code on your computer and git service provider. By configuring git with your user name and email, you'll be able to make changes on the remote copy of your code. To configure git in GeoLab, use the following commands in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git config --global user.name anu\n",
    "git config --global user.email anu@gmail.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Git Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Git manages changes to your projects. It uses repositories, which contain all your project files and their complete history. Git keeps track of every modification you make, allowing you to save different versions of your work in branch, and merge changes back into the main project. You can collaborate with others by sharing your project online with a remote repository. You can get feedback through pull requests from other project users and maintainers, and integrate their contributions seamlessly. Git keeps track of changes and lets you collaborate with other project users, making it easier to manage and improve your projects losing any work.\n"

    "## Creating a Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a repository in GeoLab. Open a terminal, and go to your home directory.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the status of all the files added to the repository. Because the repository is empty, we can create a markdown and python file and add it to the repository.\n",

    "1. `Checkout` is a safe option because you can view a version without changing any other versions and return to the current version. To checkout a commit, only the first eight or ten characters of the hash is sufficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout 10814a1c\n",
    "git checkout main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Revert` changes commits. For example, if we want to change a commit using `revert` opens a [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) editor.  To save the change, add a new message then type `:wq`. Revert does not delete a commit, it creates a new commit that shows that the commit was changed.\n",
