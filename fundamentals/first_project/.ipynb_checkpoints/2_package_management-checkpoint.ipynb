    "# Packages and Package Managers\n",
    "\n",
    "Python packages are collections of modules that provide additional functionality and tools to Python programs. These packages can contain functions, classes, and variables that are designed to perform specific tasks, ranging from data manipulation and scientific computing to web development and machine learning. Developers can leverage pre-written, tested code to save time and reduce the potential for errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python package managers are tools for installing, updating, configuring, and removing Python packages. Package anagers handle dependencies and ensure that software projects have the necessary libraries and supporting packages to run correctly. They fetch and install packages, simplifying the process of integrating external libraries into projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pip and Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip) and [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) are popular package manaers. Pip is the default package manager for Python and is commonly used because of its integration with PyPI. Conda is a package manager that comes with the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/main). Conda can handle packages from various languages and is useful in data science and scientific computing because it can manage non-Python dependencies and complex binary packages. Pip is sufficient for pure Python projects, but conda provides additional functionality and ease of use for more complex environments, making it a preferred choice for many data scientists and researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoLab is based on the [PanGeo](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-docker-images) computing environment and uses conda as the package manager. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environments are an integral part of Python development because they provide isolated environments for project development. Isolation ensures that the dependencies of one project do not conflict with those of another, which lets developers manage project-specific dependencies effectively and avoid potential conflicts between package versions. The result is an easy to manage, clean, and organized development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To list the virtual environments in GeoLab, type in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment with an asterisk is the current environment. To list the installed packages, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The list has four columns: Name, Version, Build, and Channel. The Channel is the repository for a package. If you scroll through the list, [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) is the predominant channel and [pypi or the Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) is occasionally listed. You can install packages from pypi in a conda environment and, in general, will work with the existing dependencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use or activate a specific environment, for example `base`, use the activate command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate base\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To leave an environment and change to a different environment \n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create an environment by this command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create --name <environment name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a base environment where you can add packages for your project. More information about creating and managing environments is available in the [documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). Don't forget to activate the environment after creatinf it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Python packages with conda, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command installs packages from anaconda.org. If you want to install packages from conda-forge, which has the latest version, add the channel parameter. Either syntax shown below installs package from a channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install --channel conda-forge <package_name>\n",
    "conda install conda-forge::<package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specify package versions, including Python. For example, a package may require Python 3.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install conda-forge:python=3.10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also install packages with pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoLab instances are ephemeral. That means if you install a package in either the terminal or in a notebook it will not be be there the next time you open a GeoLab instance that has been stopped. The best practice for installing packages is to install them in a notebook with a [magic command](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%pip install <package_name>\n",
    "%conda install <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will create an environment and add packages. Follow these instructions and type the commands in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the terminal change in to the geolab directory and create an environment called geolab-intro.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   conda create --name geolab-env\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. List the environments, you should see `geolab-env` in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   conda list\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Activate the geolab-intro environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   conda activate geolab-env\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. List the packages. It should be empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    conda list\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next module, we'll create a Python notebook and explore python code.\n",
    "\n",
