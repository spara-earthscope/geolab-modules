    "\n",
    "EarthScope is required by its funders to track data usage. To this end, EarthScope issues a token to access resources. Tokens are tied to your EarthScope account (which you used to log into GeoLab). Tokens are generated using either the EarthScope SDK (Software Development Kit) or CLI (Command Line Interface). Both packages are installed in GeoLab. The simplest way to generated a token is to use the EarthScope CLI. Copy and paste the command below into a termincal, then follow the instructions to get a token.\n",
